## MuseMorphose

We develop the **in-attention** mechanism to firmly control Transformer decoders with _segment-level_, _dense_ conditions. 
We then bridge the full song-level **in-attention** decoder and a _bar-wise_ Transformer encoder to construct _**MuseMorphose**_. 
Trained with the VAE objective alone, _**MuseMorphose**_ can perform style transfer of long musical pieces, 
while allowing user controls on musical attributes down to the bar level.
